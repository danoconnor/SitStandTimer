# SitStandTimer
Simple C#/XAML Universal Windows App that reminds a user to switch between multiple states/tasks at predefined times. It will fire notifications on a pre-defined schedule indicating which state the user should switch to.

This app is currently hard-coded to remind the user to switch between standing and sitting throughout the day. Eventually, it will allow the user to configure their own tasks and schedule.
